# **BAHA - Banta ng Agos Height Assessment**

## Project Description
BAHA is a smart flood-risk assessment feature designed to help commuters and residents make safer travel decisions during heavy rainfall. It estimates the expected water level on key road segments and translates this information into clear advisories, _Safe to Pass_, _Pass with Caution_, or _Do Not Pass_, allowing users to understand road conditions before and during their trips quickly.
